# Fito
What does Fito mean? Fito is File Type Organizer and is used to automatic put your files in new folders by the type of the file. 
You can run it in a folder and it automatic will create sub folders and move the respective files into it.

You can see an example bellow:
```txt
aloevera.jpg
frodo.gif
gandalf.gif
potato.jpg
zebra.mp4
``` 
After running `fito` you gonna have the following output:

  frodo.gif
  gandalf.gif
mp4 files
  zebra.mp4
```
